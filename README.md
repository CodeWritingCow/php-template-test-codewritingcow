#PHP Template Test for CodeWritingCow.com
_By Gary Pang_

This is a test for adding custom PHP templates to my portfolio website. I want all my webpages to use a single header, nav bar and footer.

For example, if I make a single change to the nav menu, I want to do it in just one file. I shouldn't have to edit every single webpage to make that change.
